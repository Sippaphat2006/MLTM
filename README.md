**OVERVIEW**
This project is about the machine light tower. To get and analyze the runtime of the machine to tower light output.
With the IoT device (ESP32) and work with RGB color sensor (TCS34725). With this setting we assume that the color
will light up one at a time, but can be calibrated to detect the color combination. and also we will only work with
three colors which is: RED (alarm), YELLOW(set up), GREEN(active).
